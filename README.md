# Lab 08: Javascript JSON API example

Navigate to a local directory where you want to store this exercise, and clone the repository from GitHub. Before you push, you will need to *change the GIT remote* to a new repository of your own with the following command: `git remote set-url origin [YOUR_REPO_URL_HERE]`.

IMPORTANT: get an [API key](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/) for the Guardian before you do anything else and replace line 10 with your key.
