# Lab 08: Javascript JSON API example

Navigate to a local directory where you want to store this exercise, and clone the repository from GitHub. Before you push, you will need to *change the GIT remote* to a new repository of your own with the following command: `git remote set-url origin [YOUR_REPO_URL_HERE]`.

<!-- 
The first part of this example uses a local web server (check that this is available) to allow your browser to read in a local JSON file, and display the results. If you can't run a local server, use the alternative JSON API source provided in the code.

## Start a local web server (if available)

If you can run a [simple local server](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally) on your machine, open a command-line console, `cd` into the directory where your index.html file is, then (if you don't already have a server setup) run one of the following commands (depending on installed languages):

- Python 2.7: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
- Python 3: `python -m http.server`
- PHP (>=5.4): `php -S localhost:8000` 

Wait until the console shows `Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000`, then go to `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser. You can stop the server with `ctrl-C` if you need to later, but your browser won't read the local JSON if you simply show index.html as a file. However, this local JSON is for experimentation so you can change the JSON data yourself and get used to navigating through JSON, although the main exercise will run without a local server and use remote JSON. -->
